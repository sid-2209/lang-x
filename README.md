# Lang-X

Lang-X is an AI-powered voice cloning application that records or accepts an audio sample in English and converts it into Spanish, French, and Mandarin while preserving the original speaker's voice characteristics. The application leverages **OpenAI Whisper** for speech-to-text, **a translation model** for multilingual support, and **Coqui TTS** for text-to-speech synthesis.

## Features 🚀

- 🎙️ **Voice Recording & Upload**: Capture voice directly from the browser.
- 📝 **Speech-to-Text (Transcription)**: Converts recorded speech into text using OpenAI Whisper.
- 🌍 **Text Translation**: Translates transcribed text into multiple languages.
- 🗣️ **Voice Cloning & Synthesis**: Generates speech in the translated language while preserving the speaker's voice.
- 📂 **Download & Playback**: Listen to or download the generated speech output.
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Built using React and Material-UI for a smooth user experience.
